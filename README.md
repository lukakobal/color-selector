# 🎨 Color Selector – Parent → Child → Parent Communication

This small project demonstrates how data moves both ways in React:

- Parent sends props to Child.
- Child calls a callback function from the Parent.
- Parent updates its state based on Child input.

This pattern is called **lifting state up** and is used constantly in real React apps.
